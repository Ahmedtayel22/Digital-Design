# Asynchronous FIFO Memory

The Asynchronous FIFO Memory is a specialized two-port memory structure designed with a predefined depth capacity. It operates using a dual-clock architecture, consisting of two separate clocks: one for read operations (i_rclk) and another for write operations (i_wclk).

## Key Features

- **Dual-Clock Operation:** The memory utilizes two distinct clocks, allowing independent control over read and write operations, facilitating efficient asynchronous data handling.

- **Dual-Address Configuration:** To manage data flow, the memory incorporates separate address pointers. One is dedicated to read operations, while the other serves write actions. This dual-address setup ensures precise data storage and retrieval.

## Data Handling

When data needs to be stored, it is written to a specific location identified by the write address. Conversely, when data retrieval is required, the memory accesses the information from the location indicated by the read address. This architecture ensures efficient and synchronized data management within the FIFO memory.

## Usage

To integrate the Asynchronous FIFO Memory into your project or system, refer to the provided documentation and guidelines for detailed implementation instructions.
