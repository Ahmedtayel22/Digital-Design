# Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR) Introduction

## What is LFSR?

The Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) is a specialized shift register designed with a feedback mechanism that combines certain output bits using exclusive-OR or exclusive-NOR configurations. The initial content of the shift register, known as the seed, is a crucial parameter. It's worth noting that any value can be used as a seed, except for an all-zero state, which is typically avoided to prevent a lookup state.

## LFSR Applications

LFSRs have diverse applications in various fields, including:

1. **Pattern Generators:** Generating repetitive bit patterns.
2. **Encryption:** Enhancing data security during transmission.
3. **Compression:** Efficiently reducing data size.
4. **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):** Detecting errors in data.
5. **Pseudo-Random Bit Sequences (PRBS):** Generating pseudo-random sequences useful in multiple applications.

## Specifications

1. **Initialization:** All registers are set to the LFSR Seed value through an asynchronous active low reset (SEED = 8'hD8).
2. **Output Registration:** All LFSR outputs are registered.
3. **Data Length:** The DATA serial bit length can vary from 1 byte to 4 bytes, with a typical configuration being 1 byte.
4. **ACTIVE Signal:** The ACTIVE input signal is high during data transmission and low at other times.
5. **CRC Calculation:** Eight CRC bits are shifted serially through the CRC output port.
6. **Valid Signal:** The VALID signal is high while transmitting CRC bits; otherwise, it's low.

## Operation

1. **Initialization:** Begin by initializing the shift registers (R7 – R0) with the predetermined LFSR seed value of 8'hD8.
2. **Data Shifting:** Shift the data bits into the LFSR in LSB (Least Significant Bit) first order.
3. **CRC Calculation:** Once the last data bit is shifted into the LFSR, the registers contain the CRC bits.
4. **CRC Output:** To obtain the CRC result, shift out the CRC bits in order (R7 – R0), with R0 containing the least significant bit (LSB).
