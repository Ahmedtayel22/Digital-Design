# Integer Clock Divider

## Introduction

The Integer Clock Divider is a circuit designed to manipulate clock signals. It takes an input signal with a frequency represented as 'fin' and produces an output signal with a frequency denoted as 'fout.' Importantly, the relationship between the input and output frequencies adheres to a simple rule: 'fout' is equal to 'fin' divided by 'n,' where 'n' is an integer.

This README provides an overview of the Integer Clock Divider, its functionality, and its relevance in various digital systems. It explains how this circuit plays a fundamental role in controlling clock frequencies to ensure synchronization and efficient operation within a digital environment. For more detailed technical information and implementation guidelines, please refer to the accompanying documentation and resources related to the Integer Clock Divider.
