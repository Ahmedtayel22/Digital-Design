# Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) and Reset Synchronization

## Clock Domain Crossing (CDC)

### Introduction

In the digital domain, Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) is a critical process that involves transferring a signal or vector (a multi-bit signal) from one clock domain to another. This transition often introduces various challenges, including metastability, data inconsistency, and potential data loss. To address these CDC issues, several techniques have been developed to synchronize asynchronous signals effectively. One such method is the Multi-Flop Synchronization Scheme, specifically designed for synchronizing single bits or multiple bits encoded in gray code.

## Reset Synchronization

### Introduction

Asynchronous reset signals can pose challenges during de-assertion, potentially violating the recovery and removal times of Flip Flops. To ensure the proper handling of asynchronous reset signals with respect to the clock domain, a Reset Synchronizer is essential in digital circuit design. In essence, a reset synchronizer transforms asynchronous reset signals into synchronous de-assertion, mitigating potential timing issues.
